              before the advanced graph days (strongly connected components, bridges, Floyd-Warshall), so the
              most asked topics are done before the capstone. The lectures use C++ or Java; the ideas carry
              over, and you write every solution in Python.

            generation end to end, then a capstone that joins it to your own systems.

      <h2 id="python">Python first, from the basics</h2>
      <p>
        The whole plan is written in Python, including the architecture and operating-systems weeks. Each of
        the first sixteen days opens with one numbered Python lesson (the official tutorial, then PEP 8 and
        pytest, in that order), so you learn the language while you use it. The first three days also start
        from the basics, with a short warm-up. Python is the only language in the plan; where it hides the
        machine, built-in modules such as <code>ctypes</code>, <code>dis</code> and <code>mmap</code> show
        what is underneath. <Link href="/python">See the Python path</Link>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="lab">The optional fifth day</h2>
      <p>
        Every week has a revision lab that you can take on a rest day or skip. It opens with a review round of
        questions from this week and earlier ones, scheduled so what you recall comes back after a day, three
        days, a week and two weeks. Then come four hands-on exercises tied to that week&apos;s project, a list
        of problems you left unchecked, and one problem to redo from scratch. It never changes your schedule.
      </p>

      <h2 id="month">The monthly review</h2>
      <p>
        After every fourth week there is a longer, optional review. It has a bigger review round and four
        exercises that join the month&apos;s work into one piece. From month 2 on it also reaches back: the
        round draws on every earlier month, and two extra exercises reopen work you did before. Skip it
        whenever you like; nothing in your schedule depends on it.
      </p>

      <h2 id="brain">Second brain</h2>
      <p>
        Each day ends with a journal. For anything longer, the notes page is a small knowledge base: write in
        Markdown, link notes to each other and to any day with <code>[[double brackets]]</code>, tag them with{" "}
        <code>#tags</code>, tick off checklists, and export everything as Markdown. It all stays in your
        browser, and your backup file includes it.
