        Then Week 1 of the main plan assumes you can write the code in it.

      <h2 id="how">How a day works</h2>
      <ol className="plain">
        <li>
          <b>Learn (about 60 to 90 minutes).</b> Start with the gentle freeCodeCamp lecture. Then the same
          topic in Google&apos;s Python Class, and a chapter of the video course if you want to see someone do
          it. Type every example yourself; do not paste.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Practice (about 60 to 90 minutes).</b> A freeCodeCamp workshop or lab, a Google exercise, and a
          small program of your own. This is the part that makes it stick, so never skip it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Check (10 minutes).</b> Answer three questions out loud from memory, then tick the day complete.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If you are stuck for more than 20 minutes, write down what you tried, take a break, and move on. Come
        back after you have slept on it. Everyone gets stuck; the goal is to get unstuck without being told
        the answer.
